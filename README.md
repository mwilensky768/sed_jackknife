# sed_jackknife
A small repository holding code for performing a Bayesian jackknife analysis of astrophysical SED data.

The code to run the polychord sampler is in polychord_hyper.py 

This will output some chains that can be post-processed with anesthetic to produce the plots etc. in the associated paper.

Processed data for performing the jackknives are in the `data` directory with an accompanying readme explaining their contents.
